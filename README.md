# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
My purpose is to use the Kickstarter dataset and develop pivot tables and charts to help Louise analyse campaign outcomes
based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The table from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date sheet will provide successful, failed, and canceled plays by the month for all years. The months of May, june  and July have the highest successful launch dates. The successful trend goes down toward the Fall and Winter months. The months of November and December have failed totals that are almost equal to successful totals. And January has the most canceled plays of any month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the table Outcomes Based on Goals the highest percentage of successful projects were under $1000 and the next successful percentage was under $1000 to $5000. And the latter group also had the most in total projects. The range from $35000 to $45000 also had a high success rate but only had 9 total projects. The highest percentage of failed projects wer in the $45000 and over $50000 range but this only accouted for 17 total projects. No projects were cancelled.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I would request you start the launch dates in May or June based on successful outcomes. I would not start any plays in December or January based on failed or cancelled outcomes.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I would request keeping any new plays in the $10,000 and under range based on success rates. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A Box Plot could be used to point out any outliers or skewed data.
