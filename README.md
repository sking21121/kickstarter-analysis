# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
My purpose is to use the Kickstarter dataset and develop pivot tables and charts to help Louise analyse campaign outcomes
based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The table from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date sheet will provide successful, failed, and canceled plays by the month for all years. The months of May, june  and July have the highest successful launch dates. The successful trend goes down toward the Fall and Winter months. The months of November and December have failed totals that are almost equal to successful totals. And January has the most canceled plays on any month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
